# Adding Puerto Rico back as a USA state in WooCommerce and removing it as a country
## Tested with WooCommerce Version: +9.5.1
## Tested with WooCommerce Subscriptions Version: +7.0.1

We recently encountered an issue affecting one of our USA-based clients who operates a WooCommerce website. 
A customer reported that Puerto Rico was not listed as a USA state in the dropdown menu when selecting states. After conducting thorough research, we discovered that Puerto Rico had been removed as a state and added as a country, which can make things difficult for the current store setups. 
To resolve this problem, we implemented a solution by adding custom code to the functions.php file. This adjustment involved removing Puerto Rico from the country list and re-adding it as a state within the United States. 
As a result, Puerto Rico now displays correctly throughout the site, including in the cart, checkout, and shipping zones. We hope this will help anyone in a similar situation.


// Code to remove Puerto Rico as a country and re-add it as a US state
function modify_shipping_locations( $locations ) {
    // Remove Puerto Rico from country list
    unset( $locations['PR'] );

    // Add Puerto Rico as a state
    $locations['US']['PR'] = 'Puerto Rico';

    return $locations;
}
add_filter( 'woocommerce_countries', 'modify_shipping_locations' );
